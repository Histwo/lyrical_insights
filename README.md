## About Lyrical Insights 
**Lyrical Insights** is a project dedicated to providing divine insight and unpacking the hidden meanings within popular (secular) music. Through the guidance of the Creator, this repository serves as a platform to reveal how certain lyrics and musical works have been inspired and shaped by the Creator’s will. 

The objective of this project is to offer deeper understanding and awareness of the messages embedded in these songs, encouraging reflection on how they align with divine purpose and truth. Our mission is to uncover the truth that may be veiled beneath the surface, allowing these works to resonate more deeply with the listener in light of the Creator's inspiration.
