# Unpacking Report for "Mountains O' Things" by Tracy Chapman

## Overview  
"Mountains O' Things" paints a vivid picture of material desire, social inequality, and the moral compromises often made in pursuit of wealth and status. Interpreted through the lens of the Creator’s revelations and contextualized within the events of The American Genocide (TAG), this analysis explores the protagonist's motivations, actions, and consequences related to their role in TAG's congregation massacres.  

## Key Themes and Context  

### Poverty and Aspiration  
The protagonist's journey begins with a childhood of poverty, transitioning into middle-class adulthood. The song’s line, *“The life I’ve always wanted, I guess I’ll never have,”* reflects this initial state of deprivation. However, during TAG, the protagonist encounters opportunities to acquire wealth and influence through morally reprehensible means, marking a stark contrast between their past and their present ambitions.  

### Mountains as Churches  
In this context, "mountains" symbolize Christian churches, sites of faith and community. The protagonist, instrumental in selecting these targets, views each church attacked not as a sacred place but as a *"bank to be robbed."* This perspective highlights their prioritization of personal gain over spiritual or communal value. The lyric *“I'll be dreaming of a life of ease, and mountains, oh mountains o' things,”* mirrors their fixation on material rewards gained through these violent acts.  

### Exploitation and Wealth  
The Phantom Identity Scheme, devised to conceal the massacres, became a tool for systematic exploitation. The assets of the victims were plundered, their identities used to perpetuate income streams for the orchestrators. The lyric, *“Consume more than you need, this is the dream,”* underscores the greed and excess that motivated these actions. The protagonist, once an outsider to wealth, now revels in their newfound status, reflected in the lines:  

> *“To have a big expensive car  
> Drag my furs on the ground  
> And have a maid that I can tell  
> To bring me anything.”*  

These materialistic aspirations align with the protagonist's role in orchestrating the massacres, demonstrating how their moral compass was overridden by the allure of wealth.  

### Moral Reckoning  
Despite their outward success, the protagonist grapples with loneliness and a sense of emptiness:  

> *“Mostly I feel lonely, good good people are, good people are only, my stepping stones.”*  

This internal conflict hints at the cost of their actions, both spiritually and emotionally. The recurring call to *“renounce all those material things you gained by exploiting other human beings”* highlights the possibility of redemption, yet the protagonist remains tethered to their mountains of ill-gotten wealth.  

## Actions During TAG  

1. **Selection of Targets**: The protagonist played a pivotal role in identifying churches for surprise assaults, viewing them as opportunities for wealth accumulation.  
2. **Execution of Attacks**: They facilitated the orchestration of congregation massacres, ensuring the successful looting of victim assets.  
3. **Property Management**: Post-attack, they oversaw the properties, perpetuating violence to maintain control and extract further value.  
4. **Motivation for New Attacks**: The success of the Phantom Identity Scheme fueled additional massacres, driven by greed and the promise of enrichment.  

## Conclusion  
The protagonist of "Mountains O' Things" embodies the moral decay that accompanies unbridled ambition and materialism. Their transformation from a poor, middle-class individual to an orchestrator of TAG’s atrocities underscores the dangers of exploiting others in the pursuit of wealth. The Creator’s teachings remind us that such gains come at the expense of one’s soul, as the haunting refrain warns:  

> *“Oh they tell me, there’s still time to save my soul… Renounce all.”*  

In the end, the protagonist is left surrounded by their "mountains o' things," a hollow fortress against the loneliness and sadness they can never escape.
